## Description

_Duration: Approximately 15 hours_

This application was created to serve as an in-browser calculator. I wanted to make all calculations that were input visible on the DOM, and allow those historical calculations to be accessed for reuse.

# Installation

1. Open this repository in your favorite code editor (VS Code was used for creating it).
1. Install node and express (don't worry, I've already got a nifty .gitignore file to avoid committing and pushing the massive node_modules!)
1. Type npm start into your terminal to start the server
1. Run localhost:5000/ in your browser
